# Recordings Directory

This directory stores player input recordings in JSON format.

Files are automatically saved here with timestamps:
- player_recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json

These files are small (typically 5-10 KB per minute) and can be:
- Analyzed for player behavior
- Used for speedrun verification
- Replayed for testing
- Shared with others

Note: You may want to add `*.json` to .gitignore if you don't want to commit recordings.
